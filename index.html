                    Call of Duty: WWII is a 2017 first-person shooter game developed by Sledgehammer Games and published by Activision. 
                    It was released worldwide on November 3, 2017 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
                    It is the fourteenth main installment in the Call of Duty series and the first title in the series to be set primarily during World War II since Call of Duty: World at War in 2008.
                    The game's campaign is set in the European theatre and is centered around a squad in the 1st Infantry Division following their battles on the Western Front and set mainly in the historical events of Operation Overlord.
                    The player controls Ronald "Red" Daniels, who has squadmates who can supply the player with extra ammunition, health, or grenades as well as a targeted grenade and target spotting; none of these are automatically replenished in the campaign.
                    The multiplayer mode features map locations not seen in the campaign. 
                    The mode also features the new Divisions system, replacing the create-a-class system that previous games in the series used.
                    A social hub, Headquarters, was also implemented into the game, allowing for players to interact with each other. 
                    Sledgehammer Games were interested in bringing the series back to World War II after developing their previous title, Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare (2014).

                        Activision Publishing, Inc. is an American video game publisher based in Santa Monica, California.
                        It serves as the publishing business for its parent company, Activision Blizzard, and consists of several subsidiary studios. 
                        Activision is one of the largest third-party video game publishers in the world and was the top United States publisher in 2016.[4]
                        The company was founded as Activision, Inc. on October 1, 1979 in Sunnyvale, California, by former Atari game developers upset at their treatment by Atari in order to develop their own games for the popular Atari 2600 home video game console. 
                        Activision was the first independent, third-party, console video game developer. 
                        The 1983 video game crash, in part created by too many new companies trying to follow in Activision's footsteps without the expertise of Activision's founders, hurt Activision's position in console games and forced the company to diversify into games for home computers, including the acquisition of Infocom. 
                        After a management shift, with CEO Jim Levy replaced by Bruce Davis, the company renamed itself to Mediagenic and branched out into business software applications. 
                        Mediagenic quickly fell into debt, and the company was bought for around US$500,000 by Bobby Kotick and a small group of investors around 1991.
